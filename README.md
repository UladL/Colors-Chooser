## 1) Intoduction
As we all know picking colors for our webistes can be difficult sometimes. But using my project and this website you can save your time and find the color you like in a few minites!

## 2) How does it work?
If you dont like the colors on your screen you can press space and it will shufle them into a random different one. But if you want to keep one or more just press the lock icon thats on that color and when you shufle next time they wont change.

## 3) How can you save the colors?
Your first option is to copy the # of the color. Another option is TO COPY THE LINK OF THE WEBSITE and when you share it with anyoneor even yourself the colors you chose will stay on there.

## 4) Future notes.
I will add so you can shufle colors on a phone too. But for it only works for pc. BUT YOU CAN STILL ACCESS THE LINK FROM YOUR PHONE AND SEE THE COLORS SOMEONE SEND YOU!!
